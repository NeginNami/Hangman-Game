# Hangman-Game

What is this game?
The hangman game is a word guessing game. At the start of game, computer choses a name and users have 12 chances to guess the letters that complete the chosen world. 
If users guess what the world is within that 12 chances, they can win. otherwise when chances gets down to 0, users lose.

What are the rules?
Game starts when user press a button on their keybord. Computer choses a word which in my game I decided to be one of the children show's name:). If the user's guess is one of the letters which exists in that randomly chosen word, it appears on top and one of the dashes which was representing that letter will disappear. If the letter that user guessed is not one of the letters in the chosen world, user's chances goes down by one. If user enters a letter that already they guessed, they will get a prompt which says they already guessed that letter and the letter won't be considered. If user complete the word by their guesses within teh 12 chances, they would win. Other wise they lose. In both condition game resets and win or loss counter 
goes up by one. Computer chose another children tv show's name.
